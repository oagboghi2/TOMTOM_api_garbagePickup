implementation.\n *\n * It allows to convert geographical coordinates into textual address representation using the TomTom's\n * [Reverse Geocode service](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-search/online-search-documentation-reverse-geocoding/reverse-geocode).\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method {{#crossLink \"ReverseGeocode/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user have two options for receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *   {{#crossLink \"ReverseGeocode/go:method\"}}{{/crossLink}} method to handle the response.\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * The final response from service is a JSON object with the following structure:\n *\n * ```js\n * {\n *   address: {\n *     buildingNumber: 19,\n *     streetNumber: 19,\n *     landmark: \"\",\n *     street: \"N 2nd St\",\n *     streetName: \"N 2nd St\",\n *     streetNameAndNumber: \"\",\n *     speedLimit: \"\",\n *     countryCode: \"US\",\n *     countrySubdivision: \"CA\",\n *     countrySecondarySubdivision: \"Santa Clara\",\n *     countryTertiarySubdivision: \"\",\n *     municipality: \"San Jose\",\n *     postalCode: \"95113\",\n *     municipalitySubdivision: \"San Francisco Bay Area\",\n *     freeformAddress: \"19 N 2nd St, San Jose, CA, 95113\"\n *   },\n *   position: \"37.337083, -121.8898\",\n *   roadUse: [\"LocalStreet\"]\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function callbackFn(response) {\n *   console.log(response);\n * }\n * tomtom.reverseGeocode()\n *   .position(\"51.759,19.449\")\n *   .go()\n *

If later, you try to generate\n         * the same route (A > B) you might get different middle points, so if you need to generate the exact same route\n         * you previously had you can do something like routing().locations(A, B).supportingPoints(C, D, E)\n         *\n         * You can use one of the following input formats to define the supporting points:\n         * * String: '52.3,4.8' or '52.3,4.8:52.37,4.87'\n         * * String[]: ['52.3,4.8:52.37,4.87', '52.3,4.8:52.37,4.87']\n         * * Object: {lat: 52.3, lon: 4.8} or {lat: 53.3, lng: 5.8} or {x: 53.3, y: 5.8} or {latitude: 53.3, longitude: 5.8}\n         * * Object[]: [{lat: 52.3, lon: 4.8}] or [{lat: 53.3, lng: 5.8}]\n         *\n         * How 'Supporting Points' differ from 'Waypoints?' - Waypoints are points where the calculated route will go through, but\n         * the resulting route might be different from search to search, the waypoints order might not be necessarilly respected\n         * when calculating the best route, and finally, there is a limit to the number of waypoints you can use in a route calculation.\n         * Supporting points can be used to contruct a previous route entirely, or parts of it, using the previous generated points,\n         * meaning that there is no limit to the number of points, and the order of these points will be respected.\n         *\n         * For more information please refer to the [Routing API Docs](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-routing/online-routing-documentation-routing/calculate-route)\n         *\n         * @method supportingPoints\n         * @chainable\n         * @param {String|String[]|Object|Object[]} [locations] Supporting points for route calculation.\n         * @throws {TypeError} if the given argument cannot be converted to a valid value\n         * @return {String} Method returns the service instance allowing chaining or converted locations\n         *     value if argument is omitted.\n         *\n         * @example\n         * ```js\n         * tomtom.routing()\n         *   .locations('52.3,4.8:52.37,4.87')\n         *   .supportingPoints('52.33357,4.852')\n         *   .go()\n         *   .then(function(routeGeoJson) {\n         *     console.log(routeGeoJson);\n         *   });\n         * ```\n         */\n        /* eslint-enable max-len */\n        supportingPoints: {\n            validator: validators.supportingPoints,\n            converter: converters.supportingPoints\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * A getter and setter for the 'avoidAreas' attribute.\n         *\n         * A list of shapes to avoid for planning routes.

It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map. A value of this parameter can\n *     be set to an options object as described in the traffic layer documentation.\n *     If traffic layers are added with this option, a mechanism for periodic refresh of the traffic data is provided\n *     (using a proper traffic model id handling).\n * @param {Boolean} [options.traffic.noRefresh] Disables periodic updates of traffic layers.\n * @param {Number} [options.traffic.refresh=30000] The traffic incidents information changes and needs to be updated\n *     periodically. By default, it is refreshed every 30 seconds. This parameter's value represents the time\n *     in milliseconds between each update interval. The value must be 0 or greater.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.trafficFlow] Allows to add {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficFlowLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}}\n *     to the map. A value of this parameter can be set to the options object as described in the traffic flow layer\n *     documentation.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.noLabelsOnTop=false] If a traffic or traffic flow layer is overlayed on the map, then by\n *     default, the labels layer is added on top of these layers. It prevents labels from being covered by the traffic\n *     tubes or traffic flow. With this option, it is possible to disable this behaviour.\n * @param {String|String[]} [options.source=\"raster\"] Sets the initial source and determines which tiles types will be\n *     displayed (raster, vector). If an array is given first item is used as a default source and next items are\n *     initialized but not displayed. If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk, which will be used in relative paths.\n * E.g if you set this options to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`\n * etc.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata. The extensions .png, .json\n * and scale factor will be appended at the end of URL automatically. The sprite URL is required to display icons\n * like road shields on vector maps.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/sprite/sprite\"\n * ```\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomControl=true] Show a zoom control at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.panControl=false] Enable the pan controls at the top left corner of the map.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.zoomsliderControl=false] Shows a vertical slider to control the zoom level.\n * It is recommended to disable the default zoom control option (`zoomControl=false`) when you use this feature.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.worldCopyJump=true]\n */\n\n/* This method is implemented in staticMapImageFactory.js but documented here due to a\n   yuidoc's bug in the @for tag */\n/**\n * Returns an URL string to obtain an static image version of the current map's viewport.\n *\n * This method uses the {{#crossLink \"StaticMapImage\"}}{{/crossLink}} class to generate an URL to get static image\n * based on the configuration of the current map's instance.\n *\n * @method getStaticMapUrl\n * @return {String} An URL string to the image\n */\n/* jshint nomen:false */\ndefine([\n    'leaflet',\n    './svgIcon',\n    './imagePath',\n    'mapboxProvider',\n    'security',\n    'services/copyrightCaption',\n    './copyright',\n    './layers/trafficWithIncidents',\n    './layers/trafficFlowLayer',\n    './layers/labelsLayer',\n    './layers/vector/vectorLabelsLayer',\n    './layers/tileLayer',\n    './layers/vector/vectorLayer',\n    '../config/unit/unitService',\n    '../config/unit/globalUnitService',\n    '../config/language/localeService',\n    '../config/language/globalLocaleService',\n    '../config/geopolView/geopolViewService',\n    '../config/geopolView/globalGeopolViewService',\n    'services/routing/routingContext',\n    'services/utils',\n    './mapUtils',\n    './layerOptionsUpdater'\n],\nfunction(\n    L,\n    svgIcon,\n    imagePath,\n    mapboxProvider,\n    security,\n    copyrightCaption,\n    copyright,\n    trafficWithIncidents,\n    trafficFlow,\n    labelsLayer,\n    VectorLabelsLayer,\n    tileLayer,\n    VectorLayer,\n    UnitService,\n    globalUnitService,\n    LocaleService,\n    globalLocaleService,\n    GeopolViewService,\n    globalGeopolViewService,\n    RoutingContext,\n    utils,\n    mapUtils\n) {\n    'use strict';\n    var EVENTS = {\n        /**\n         * Fired when attribution was fully loaded.

If isn't define the name of the property will be used.\n *  - validator: Function(value) If the value isn't valid this function should throw an Error,\n *      otherwise it should return the value validated\n *  - defaultValue: Function() This function have to return the default value\n *  - converter: Function(value) The returned value of this function will be used\n *\n * This is an example of configurations this module could take:\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {\n *     name: 'bestCity',\n *     validator: function (name) {\n *       if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) throw new Error('City name is not valid');\n *       return name;\n *     },\n *     converter: function (name) {\n *       return name.toLowerCase();\n *     },\n *     defaultValue: function() {\n *       return 'Lodz';\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * var config = require('chain')(properties);\n * config.city(); // prints \"lodz\"\n * config.city('Torun'); // prints \"torun\"\n * config.city(); // prints \"torun\"\n * ```\n *\n * Take notice the converter function is always executed, even for the default value.\n *\n * As second argument a function will be expected and this function will be executed using the \"go\" method\n * returned by this constructor.\n * The additional functions returned by this constructor are: \"go\", \"callback\" and \"fail\".\n *\n * The \"go\" function will execute the function passed as second argument of the constructor which should\n * implement the next signature: goFunction(properties, callback) .\n *\n * Is expected that the \"goFunction\" will call the callback function available in the second argument which is the same\n * function defined in fields.callback or the first argument passed to the \"go\" function.\n *\n * The \"go\" method can receive two callback arguments: \"success\" and \"fail\" which will override the initial callbacks\n * defined during the creation and will be continue to be used in the next execution of the \"go\" function.\n *\n * If a callback is not provided nor in the fields.callback or as first argument of the \"go\" call,\n * then the \"go\" function will return a Promise, otherwise this function will return undefined.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {},\n *   country: {}\n * }\n * var defaults = {city: 'Lima', country: 'Peru'};\n * function sendToBackend(properties, callback) {\n *   // Ajax call sending the properties\n *   // ...\n *   callback(\"OK\");\n * }\n * function onSuccess() {};\n * function onfail() {};\n *\n * var config = require('chain')(properties, sendToBackend, defaults);\n *\n * // Calling \"go\" passing callbacks\n * config.go(onSuccess, onfail);\n *\n * // Calling go and receive a Promise\n * config.go()\n *   .then(onSuccess)\n *   .catch(onFail);\n * ```\n *\n * Do you think this was difficult to read?

API](https://developer.tomtom.com/online-routing/online-routing-documentation-routing/calculate-route);\n *\n * Parameters can be passed to the constructor or provided via convenient methods that can be chained until\n * the method go performs the actual call.\n *\n * The call is asynchronous therefore the user has two options to receive the response:\n *  - Passing a callback function.\n *  - Use the {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} returned by the\n *    go method to handle the response.\n *\n * The SDK provides a {{#crossLink \"Promise\"}}{{/crossLink}} polyfill for browsers (IE<9)\n * without native ECMAScript 6 support.\n *\n * ### The types used in routing service\n *  - point - latitude, longitude pair (in EPSG4326 projection), with the following constraints: \n *    - Latitude values must be in the range -90..+90 inclusive.\n *    - Longitude values must be in the range -180..+180 inclusive. \n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406\n * \n *  - circle - A circle with a center point and a radius (in meters).\n *    - The radius must be a positive integer with the maximum value of 20050000.\n *    - Note that larger integer values will not be rejected but lowered to the maximum value. \n *    - Example: circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - location - A point or a circle.\n *    - Example: 52.37245,4.89406  circle(52.37245,4.89406,10000)\n *\n *  - dateTime - A date and time specified in RFC-3339 format with an optional time zone offset. \n *    - Example: 1996-12-19T16:39:57  1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00\n *\n * @class Routing\n * @module Services\n * @uses
